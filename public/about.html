<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! My name is Maryan and i'm 35 years old.<br />
 I'm the kind of person who quietly observes the world, collects little sparks of inspiration, and then turns them into something colorful and creative <br />
 usually with paint, resin, or clay.<br />
I'm not a fan of small talk, but if you bring up art, deep conversations,<br /> or the beauty of just being yourself, we'll probably become instant friends.<br />
I'm on a mission to build a life that feels like peace and looks like a dream.<br />
Some people chase deadlines.I chase sunsets, sparkly ideas, and the perfect cup of comfort (usually tea or quiet time).<br />
I believe in kindness, bold creativity, and making things that mean something.<br/>
i don't always know what to say about myself… but if you stick around long enough,<br /> you'll discover I'm full of soul, a little magic, and a lot of heart. <br />
</p>

<p>I'm a creative soul with a curious mind and a passion for turning ideas into reality <br />whether that's through painting, pouring resin, or writing lines of code.<br />
Yep, I'm the kind of person who can lose track of time while debugging a program and while <br /> mixing colors for an art piece. Balance, right?<br />
I'm all about creating things that feel meaningful <br />whether that's art you can hang on your wall or software that makes life easier.<br />
I like learning new things, figuring out how stuff works,<br /> and making beautiful or useful things with my hands (and brain).<br />
 Programming is like solving a puzzle, and I love that "aha!" moment when something finally clicks.<br />
I'm not the loudest in the room, but<br /> I'm the one you can count on for thoughtful ideas, genuine vibes, and an unexpected sense of humor.<br />
I value comfort, real connections, and being around people who just get it.<br />
Still figuring out parts of the journey<br />but always moving forward, with heart, curiosity, and maybe a bit of glitter (or code).<br />
</p>

<p>I'm not just learning programming for fun,Im in it with purpose.<br />
  My goal is to become the kind of developer who can bring ideas to life from the ground up,<br /> whether its designing beautiful, user-friendly front-end interfaces or building solid,<br />efficient back-end systems that power everything behind the scenes.<br />
I'm passionate about both sides of development—front-end for the creativity<br /> and user experience, and back-end for the logic, structure,and behind-the-curtain magic.<br />
I love figuring out how things work under the hood, from databases to APIs to server logic,<br /> and how it all connects to create something smooth and functional.<br />
I'm working toward becoming a full-stack developer, mastering languages like JavaScript and<br /> Python,digging into frameworks like React, Node.js, Express,<br /> and maybe even exploring Next.js or Django.<br />
Whether it's building responsive websites, scalable web apps, or complete digital platforms,<br /> I want to be hands-on in every part of the process.<br />
One of my biggest dreams is to build and launch my own apps and things that feel helpful,<br /> inspiring, and maybe even a little magical.<br />
I also hope to explore new programming languages, contribute to open-source projects,<br /> and carve out a place for myself in <br />the tech world in a way thats meaningful and uniquely me.<br />
